# Kudu Scripts

This is a collection of scripts that make it easier to work with Kudu in Windows Azure.  To use the scripts:

* clone this repo into the root of your project
* copy the .deployment file from the repository to the root of your project
* change the path in the .deployment file to match the script you'd like to use
* modify the script to point at your project file
